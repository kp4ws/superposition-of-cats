# Superposition Of Cats
A 2D Platformer I created for GameDev.tv's 2023 Game Jam.

## Background
Based on the idea of Schr√∂dinger's cat, you play as a cat that is both alive and dead. You can traverse the overworld and underworld by pressing the space key.

## Legacy
I would like to turn this into a Mario style platformer game that has multiple levels with enemies, abilities, and pickups.
