# Superposition Of Cats

## About
This project is part of the GameDev.tv 2023 Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023  

**Theme: Life in 2 dimensions!**  

This is the second game jam that I've participated in now and it's been a really fun time. I gained more experience developing 2D platformers and applied my knowledge from my Astronomy course, regarding Schrödinger's cat, to create a unique and interesting game.
